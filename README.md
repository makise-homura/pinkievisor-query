# pinkievisor-query
An userscript for Greasemonkey to enable pinkievisor popups on Tabun

Could be used to ease getting post and comment stats from [Pinkievisor](https://pinkievisor.info) for [Tabun](https://tabun.everypony.ru) posts and comments.

Once script is installed, you may:
* Click a number between 'vote up' and 'vote down' arrows for a comment, to get pinkievisor stats for this comment;
* Click a little Pinkie's head between 'vote none' and 'vote down' arrows for a post, to get pinkievisor stats for this post.

Stats will appear in pop-up "window". It can be closed by clicking a close button in its top right corner.

# pinkievisor-query
An userscript for Greasemonkey to enable pinkievisor popups on Tabun

Could be used to ease getting post and comment stats from [Pinkievisor](https://pinkievisor.info) for [Tabun](https://tabun.everypony.ru) posts and comments.

Once script is installed, you may click a little Pinkie's head in post header or comment info block, to get pinkievisor stats for this comment or post.

Stats will appear in pop-up "window". It can be closed by clicking anywhere except this window.

Window could be moved by dragging its caption, and resized by dragging a little pink triangle in its bottom right corner.

New size of window is saved in localStorage, so you may set the size you feel nice for your screen.
